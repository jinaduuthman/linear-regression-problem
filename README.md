# linear-regression-problem
Linear regression is a very common method of making predictions. You should learn both ways of solving for the coefficients: matrix inversion and gradient descent.

You have decided to create a company called ”Zillom” that estimates the price that a house will sell for. I have given you a spreadsheet (properties.xlsx) with the features and prices of 519 houses that have sold recently in Cleveland. The first five columns are the features you will use to predict prices:
• sqft hvac: Indoor square footage
• sqft yard: Outdoor square footage
• bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house
• bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house
• miles to school: Number of children would need to walk to the nearest elementary school

You are going to use this spreadsheet (and linear regression!) to create a formula for predicting the sale price of any house in Cleveland.

Run the code with below:  python3 linreg_mi.py properties.xlsx
